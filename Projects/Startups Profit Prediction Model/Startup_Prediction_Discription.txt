Objective: Develop a machine learning model to accurately calculate profit of 50 start up dataset on the basis of R&D spend, Administration, Marketing Spend. 

Dataset Description:

This dataset is originally from the 50 start up dataset of organizations. 
The objective of the dataset isto accurately calculate profit of 50 start up dataset on the basis of R&D spend, Administration, Marketing Spend. 
included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.

Content
The datasets consists of several  R&D spend, Administration, Marketing Spend and Label which is Profit.
Predictor variables includes the Profit they will get on the basis of features amount.


Number of Instances: 50

Number of Attributes: 3 plus class

For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued)

R&D spend = 50 data's in numeric format

Administration amount = 50 data's in numeric format

Marketing Amount = 50 data's in numeric format


Profit prediction will get takes place according to user provided values of 3 features i.e. R&D spend, Administration, Marketing Spend.

Using  Machine Learning Multiple Regression Algorithm here as we have all numerical and continuous data and we have to predict the profit range.
